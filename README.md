VoteSure is a decentralized, user-driven insurance platform where users can vote on insurance plans and claims. It enables a transparent and community-driven approach to insurance management.

About the Project
Insurance Voting: Users vote to determine which insurance plans are made available on the platform.
Claims Voting: Users vote to approve or deny insurance claims, ensuring fair and democratic decision-making.
Decentralized Execution: The platform uses Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Mantle Sepolia Testnet to handle all transactions and logic.

Development Status
This project is still under development. Currently, only the smart contract code for the initial version has been uploaded. Future updates will include frontend, backend integration, and additional features.

Stay tuned for updates!
